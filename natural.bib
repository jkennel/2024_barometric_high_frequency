We develop a generalised frequency domain approach to disentangle the impacts of Earth and atmospheric tides on groundwater level responses. By considering the complex harmonic properties of the signal, we improve upon a previous method for quantifying barometric efficiency (BE), while simultaneously assessing system confinement and estimating hydraulic conductivity and specific storage. We demonstrate and validate this novel approach using an example barometric and groundwater pressure record with strong Earth tide influences. Our method enables improved and rapid assessment of subsurface processes and properties using standard pressure measurements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	volume = {14},
	doi = {10.3178/hrl.14.111},
	abstract = {To classify the aquifer type and to estimate the pneumatic diffusivity using harmonic analysis and analytical expressions, we measured groundwater levels and barometric pressure in an unconfined aquifer with a thick unsaturated zone at a southern part of the Beppu volcanic fan, Japan. The groundwater level was inversely related to the barometric pressure, with little or no time lag behind barometric pressure. The groundwater level and barometric pressure exhibit periodic changes with prominent spectra at K1 (lunar-solar diurnal) and S2 (main solar semidiurnal) tidal constituents but not at O1 (main lunar diurnal) and M2 (main lunar semidiurnal) tidal constituents, which are the motions of solar and lunar relative to the earth. It indicates that the aquifer is an unconfined aquifer type with no earth tide effect. Pneumatic diffusivity in the unsaturated zone was estimated as 7.6 × 10–2 to 5.7 × 10–3 m2/s using changes between the groundwater level and the barometric pressure. The pneumatic diffusivity and the unsaturated zone thickness strongly affect amplitude ratios and phase lags between the groundwater level and the barometric pressure in the unconfined aquifer.},

	abstract = {Subsurface airflow in unsaturated zones induced by natural forcings is of importance in many environmental and engineering fields, such as environmental remediation, water infiltration and groundwater recharge, coastal soil aeration, mine and tunnel ventilation, and gas exchange between soil and atmosphere. This review synthesizes the published literature on subsurface airflow driven by natural forcings such as atmospheric pressure fluctuations, topographic effect, water table fluctuations, and water infiltration. The present state of knowledge concerning the mechanisms, analytical and numerical models, and environmental and engineering applications related to the naturally occurring airflow is discussed. Airflow induced by atmospheric pressure fluctuations is studied the most because of the applications to environmental remediation and transport of trace gases from soil to atmosphere, which are very important in understanding biogeochemical cycling and global change. Airflow induced by infiltration is also an extensively investigated topic because of its implications in rainfall infiltration and groundwater recharge. Airflow induced by water table fluctuations is important in coastal areas because it plays an important role in coastal environmental remediation and ecological systems. Airflow induced by topographic effect is studied the least. However, it has important applications in unsaturated zone gas transport and natural ventilation of mines and tunnels. Finally, the similarities and differences in the characteristics of the air pressure and airflow are compared and future research efforts are recommended.},
